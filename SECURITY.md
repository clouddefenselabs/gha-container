# Security Policy

The security of my projects is very important to me.  While a lot of code I post is open-ended, I do not guarantee that it doesn't have security issues. Some tools I have posted on my GitHub are Cybersecurity testing tools and may have inherent flaws.

Please contact me as soon as possible if you find any security vulnerabilities or have any security-related questions about this repository. I am grateful for your responsible disclosure of the issue and I will try my best to resolve it quickly.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security vulnerability, please do the following:

1. Navigate to the Security tab of this repository on GitHub.
2. Select "Report a vulnerability”.
3. Give a detailed explanation of the vulnerability and how it could affect the repository.
4. Attach any relevant information or a PoC (Proof of Concept) to demonstrate the vulnerability, if possible.
5. Send the report.

I will receive a private notification and start looking into the reported vulnerability as soon as possible. Please keep the vulnerability confidential and do not share it with anyone else until I have resolved the issue.

## Scope

All the code and files in this repository and its dependencies that I actively maintain are covered by this security policy. If you discover a security issue in a dependency that I do not directly maintain, please report it responsibly to the relevant project. I work hard to keep this project secure, but please understand that as a solo developer, I may face challenges in terms of resources, response times, and solutions. I appreciate your assistance in improving the security of this project.
